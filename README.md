# Cross-Exchange-Flash-loan-Arbitrage
This repository hosts a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate cross-exchange arbitrage between two prominent decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Uniswap and Sushiswap. The contract is developed using the Hardhat framework, providing a robust and efficient environment for smart contract development and testing.

Arbitrage, in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), refers to the practice of exploiting price discrepancies between different DEXs to generate profits. This smart contract automates the process of identifying and executing arbitrage opportunities between Uniswap and Sushiswap, two leading DEXs in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The contract leverages the liquidity pools of both Uniswap and Sushiswap to execute trades in a trustless and decentralized manner. By comparing token prices across both exchanges, the contract identifies favorable trading opportunities and executes transactions to capitalize on these price differentials.

Developers can use this contract as a foundation for building more sophisticated trading strategies or as a learning resource to understand the mechanics of cross-exchange arbitrage in DeFi. With clear documentation and comprehensive testing, the contract ensures reliability and security in handling arbitrage transactions across Uniswap and Sushiswap.
